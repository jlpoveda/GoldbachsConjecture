# GoldbachsConjecture

Implementation of the [Golbach's Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture)

A Goldbach number is a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two odd primes.

Therefore, another statement of Goldbach's conjecture is that all even integers greater than 4 are Goldbach numbers.

The expression of a given even number as a sum of two primes is called a Goldbach partition of that number
